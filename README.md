# ABOUT
  - This is a vector2 algebra library implemented in C++. Currently it has the following fictures:
    - vector addition
    - vector subtraction
    - scalar multiplication
    - scalar division
    - euqality comparison
    - vector magnitude or module operation
    - distance between two vectors
    
   - all the functions are described in the vec2.h file and implemented in the vec2.cpp file
   
# RUNNING 
  - In Linux, via command line using the makefile:
    - make -> compiles and generates the executable
    - make run -> compiles, if not, and executes the sample code
    - make clean -> removes all obj files and the executable
